I'm a budding software developer with a strong interest in data science, backend engineering, and full-stack development. While I'm just starting out and haven't yet stepped into the professional world, I'm super passionate about learning and growing in these areas.

This blog is my space to document my journey, share what I'm learning, and showcase the projects I'm working on.
